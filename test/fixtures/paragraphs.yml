Hell, she'd never put _herself_ in her fantasies before, much less anyone she knew. And then, to break that 'rule' in such an extreme way, with so much violence and cruelty... She felt vaguely ill.

But at the same time, I realize how big of a sacrifice it is to tell someone, 'okay, you be in charge,' because I know I _couldn't_ do it. And the idea of someone doing that for me is... it's amazing. It makes me feel... um... like I have a hell of a lot to live up to, but like I must be able to do it, or else she wouldn't believe in me like that." She cuddled Anne close to her side. "And, of course, there's no greater trust than to tell someone that they can do whatever they want to you. Of course receiving that trust feels good! As to the... um... other stuff... it's pretty much human nature, too. The bad part of human nature. The part that feels strong and powerful when it sees someone else weak and vulnerable. But really, it's all pretty easy to understand. If you want something confusing, ask _her_ what she gets out of it.  Good luck, though, I haven't really got an answer I understand yet."

They don't honestly know what it is; it's too high for them to measure. I read calculus books for fun. I can calculate tensor equations in my head. I don't sleep. An hour or two a night, maybe, if I'm bored. I haven't for years. According to the doctors, I should have been both dead and incurably insane years ago.

The evening had been... interesting. She wasn't sure why the expected lecture on discretion never happened, but it didn't. Her mother was looking more than a bit frazzled though, which was worrying. But she had to admit things had gone pretty well. Her mother was friendly and accepting, Siobhan was trying hard, and Anne even managed to get a bit less shy, but that was going to take a while. There was one minor embarrassing moment -- Brynna hadn't even thought about asking her mother if Anne could sleep over. She was used to being the one to approve or disapprove Siobhan's sleepovers, not having one herself or having to answer to anyone else about it. It was... weird.

Could that be the reason behind the sorrowful gaze -- she was looking not for a girlfriend but a rescuer? Well hell, Bryn could do _that_! She straightened, flooded with relief, and started to turn and ask, just blurt it out, but she froze, confused again as she remembered the _real_ skin that she'd seen had been totally unmarked.

"And, of course, there's no greater trust than to tell someone that they can do whatever they want to you. Of course receiving that trust feels good!

The evening had been... interesting. She wasn't sure why the expected lecture on discretion never happened, but it didn't. Her mother was looking more than a bit frazzled though, which was worrying. But she had to admit things had gone pretty well. Her mother was friendly and accepting, Siobhan was trying hard, and Anne even managed to get a bit less shy, but that was going to take a while. There was one minor embarrassing moment -- Brynna hadn't even thought about asking her mother if Anne could sleep over. She was used to being the one to approve or disapprove Siobhan's sleepovers, not having one herself or having to answer to anyone else about it. It was... weird.
