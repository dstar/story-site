    Prudence is the second story we wrote in the world of Demon's Dream, and the first to be released. It chronicles the story of a new teacher in a small town who discovers that life in a small town is very different from the world he knew. When he falls in love with one of his students, his life begins to change in ways he never expected, and he learns that, just like Horatio, there's more under heaven and earth than dreamt of in his philosophy.
    
    We''ve released around 76,000 words on this, so far, and we're committed to getting at least 2,000 a month out in the future. We've got approximately 100,000 words ready for editing on this one; unfortunately, it's the old style, and editing is a pain.

    The answer lies in the distant past, in the roots of Trina's family tree, and Zoe could never have guessed...
