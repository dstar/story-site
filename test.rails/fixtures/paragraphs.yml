The evening had been... interesting. She wasn't sure why the expected lecture on discretion never happened, but it didn't. Her mother was looking more than a bit frazzled though, which was worrying. But she had to admit things had gone pretty well. Her mother was friendly and accepting, Siobhan was trying hard, and Anne even managed to get a bit less shy, but that was going to take a while. There was one minor embarrassing moment -- Brynna hadn't even thought about asking her mother if Anne could sleep over. She was used to being the one to approve or disapprove Siobhan's sleepovers, not having one herself or having to answer to anyone else about it. It was... weird.

The evening had been... interesting. She wasn't sure why the expected lecture on discretion never happened, but it didn't. Her mother was looking more than a bit frazzled though, which was worrying. But she had to admit things had gone pretty well. Her mother was friendly and accepting, Siobhan was trying hard, and Anne even managed to get a bit less shy, but that was going to take a while. There was one minor embarrassing moment -- Brynna hadn't even thought about asking her mother if Anne could sleep over. She was used to being the one to approve or disapprove Siobhan's sleepovers, not having one herself or having to answer to anyone else about it. It was... weird.
