    Imagine a world much like ours on the surface. Beneath, however, lies a very different truth. Elves, were-creatures, and demons walk the earth with us...as do other, more dangerous creatures. Humans, did they but know it, are both the weakest creatures and the most important, for without their belief, the gods themselves would fail.
    
    Some of the novels in this world will be submitted for professional publication; others, however are not suitable due to their subject matter. Therefore, they will be released for free on the net. We don't write for money; we write because we need to.
    
    Not that we _object_ to money, you understand.

  description: These stories are all set in their own worlds, unconnected to any other stories. Should we write a sequel or related story, they'll get their own section.
