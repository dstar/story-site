#+CATEGORY: story-site
* DONE tweak various things for sessions and session data to actually _work_
  properly in terms of restricting access, and saving comments, etc.  
* DONE There is no caching of any kind as yet. It would be nice to add
  appropriate caching.
* DONE no Ajax for e.g. paragraph comments, paragraph
  editing. would be nice
  to make it use Ajax, which I shall work on when I get a
  chance. HOWTO (for edit): change link to ajaxically pull in
  paragraphs/_form.rhtml (separate action) if javascript  enabled,
  otherwise link to edit action. same-same for comments.
* DONE Add column 'read' to pcomments. Takes an array of author names.
* DONE stylesheets, and, in general, class names for divs, etc. should be
  mapped to the current stylesheet set-- the other choice would be to
  create a new stylesheet that matches the current layout, which might
  actually be a better idea. For that matter, one stylesheet is not
  consistently being used; this needs to be fixed.
  code to get all stylesheet elements:
      require 'rexml/document'
      xml = REXML::Document.new(File.open("filename"))
      # keys of @hash are our css elements
      @hash = Hash.new
      xml.elements.each do |e|
        @hash["#{e}.#{c.attributes["class"]}"] = 1
        @hash["#{e}"] = 1
      end
* DONE should add the javascript bit for changing stylesheets to the layout
  pages once there are two stylesheets
* DONE am not sure if sessions store cookies for <foo>.pele.cx or just
  pele.cx; ideally want only pele.cx so that data is carried over
  between the subdomains?
* DONE (if test chapter arrives ok) Send to ASSM functionality
* DONE Send to SOL functionality
* DONE Keywords
* DONE Auto-dump chapters
* TODO Auto-release chapters at a specific date/time
** DONE Import old blog entries
